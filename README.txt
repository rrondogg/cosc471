ur gonna have to create a .env file to make variables for ur database connections
the script is an empty script for the lastest version of the database im working with; i shedded a lot of useless columns from it

in the package.json you can see all the dependencies so you know what to install
in terminal just do : npm i whateverlibrary 

theres a library in the json file called jsonwebtockens, that shit isnt used anywhere and i forgot why i included it in the first place
its stuck around since i setup the project though so i have some otherwordly heuristics telliing me not to touch it so you shouldnt either
